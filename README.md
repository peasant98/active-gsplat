# Active Learning for Gaussian Splatting

This repo is a minimal implementation of active learning for Gaussian Splatting. It is customizable and allows for real-time training of splats.

This work supports the paper [HP-GS: Human Preference Next Best View Selection for 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3gCQJGRSSY). Link coming soon!
