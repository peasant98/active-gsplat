Some observations of how I chose a preferred image:

- Images containing dense content (more objects, colour, etc) had higher chances of being distorted/containing noise
- Blemishes
- Random artifacts
- Blurriness
- Distortion on walls (sometimes smoothness also acts as a distortion on walls/objects with a certain amount of texture)
